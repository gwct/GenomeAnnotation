# Snakemake workflows
In this directory we provide snakefiles, config files and slurm profiles for using [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to run the transcript assemblers and genome annotation tools we evaluate. For these workflows to be used in other settings, snakemake must be installed--preferrably in a conda environment--along with the implemented bioformatics tools and associated dependencies.
